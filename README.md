# DJACM-website

<h1>Description:</h1>
This website was developed for one the best student chapters of my college, D J Sanghvi college of Engineering, Mumbai. DJ-ACM was a known student chapter for all their innovative events, workshops and technical and info-tech team.

This was made in 2013 as the official ACM website. It was made as a one page website which was a trend and state-of-the-art that time. It has a good amount of visual beauty and simplicity. 
The technologies used mostly are-n HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery etc. 
Some open source tools lioke FancyBox were also used.


<b>NOTE:</b>
I did not create the entire site, it was made by a team of 5 under our webmaster with his great guidance. Credits at the bottm of the site page itself.
